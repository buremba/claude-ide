Run a comprehensive demo of all termos interactive components. For every `termos run` command, include `--width 80 --height 60 --x 10 --y 20`. Use each of these in sequence:

1. First, use `termos run confirm` to ask if user wants to proceed with the demo
2. Use `termos run ask --questions '[{"question":"Project name?","options":["App A","App B"]}]'` to gather project preferences
3. Use `termos run checklist` with items "Build project,Run tests,Deploy,Send notifications" to let user select tasks
4. Use `termos run progress` with steps "Initialize,Build,Test,Package,Deploy" to show build progress
5. Use `termos run table` with /workspace/demo/data.json to display team data
6. Use `termos run code` with /workspace/demo/sample-code.ts highlighting lines 12-18
7. Use `termos run markdown` with /workspace/demo/plan.md to show the implementation plan
8. Use `termos run mermaid` with /workspace/demo/diagram.mmd to render the flowchart

Run each component one by one and briefly explain what each demonstrates. This showcases the full termos interactive capabilities!
